TinyVote
========

A super simple voting platform that does ranked voting with an instant runoff algorithm.

### Use Cases

TinyVote is currently suitable for any situation where you trust the voters to not game the system by submitting duplicate votes, as it does not yet support restricting votes by login. 

- Select officers for a school club
- Pick a team leader for a project
- Elect the president of the United States
